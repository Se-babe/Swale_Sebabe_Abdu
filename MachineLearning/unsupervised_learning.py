#what is unsupervised learning

#characteristics of unsupervised leanring
#no labelling of data provided
#the model identity hidden patterns ,structures
#used for EDA exploratory data analysis
#can handle large volumes of data

#techniques
#clustering
#Dimensionality reduction
#Anomaly Detection
# Association Rule Learning


#clustering
#algorithms for clustering
#k-means clustering
#hierarchical clustering
#density based spartial clustering (DBSCAN)

#advantages of unsupervised learning
#useful for discovering unknown patterns
#no need for labelling data
#can handle large  ,complex data
#flexible for EDA

#example one: Real problem
#create a data set to cluster customers based on their anual income and spending
#k - means clustering
